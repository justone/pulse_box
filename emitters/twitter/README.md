# Twitter emitter

Version 1 should just output a message any time

- mediatemple tweets
- someone says "media temple", "#mediatemple", "@mediatemple"

Very inspired by the [just for func](https://github.com/campoy/justforfunc/tree/master/14-twitterbot) episode.

Credentials are from apps.twitter.com
Each user will need to set TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY, TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET, TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN, TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
